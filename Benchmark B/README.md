Benchmark B

This code provides Benchmark B comparisons for EEG artifact removal, enabling side-by-side evaluation of multiple denoising models under a unified protocol (4-s segments with 50% overlap, per-segment minâ€“max normalization, and metrics including RRMSE-time, RRMSE-frequency via Welch PSD, and Pearson CC). The setup mirrors the settings described in the original DAE study.
